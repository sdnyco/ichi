# M8 — Hook Ticker Refinement (Implementation Summary)
Date: 2025-12-29
Run: M8-HOOK-TICKER-20251229-1810

## Goal
Replace the initial hook cycling prototype with a CSS-only “push” ticker that mimics public transit signage while honoring reduced-motion preferences.

## Implemented
- Replaced `CyclingHookCaption` with a new `HookTickerList` wrapper that keeps the 3 s cadence, limits to the first three hooks, and shares a single ticker slot per card.
- Added `HookTicker`, which handles the actual push animation using two absolutely positioned lines, transform-only transitions (520 ms cubic-bezier), and `prefers-reduced-motion` short-circuiting.
- Ensured timers reset when hook data changes, intervals clear on unmount, and the ticker window keeps a fixed `h-6`/`leading-6` height to prevent layout shifts.

## Files Added / Updated
- Updated: `src/components/place-gallery.tsx`
- Added: `docs/implementation-summaries/M8-HOOK-TICKER-20251229-1810.md`

## Known Issues / Follow-ups
- Still capped at three hooks; extending beyond that would need pagination or faster cycling.
- The ticker currently relies on `aria-live="polite"` but does not expose manual controls; review for accessibility once the interaction model stabilizes.
