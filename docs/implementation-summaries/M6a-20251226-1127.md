# M6a — Anchoring (Place-Scoped Reachability)

## Anchoring Overview
Anchoring is now stored as a declarative, place-scoped flag that lets a user announce “I am attachable to this place” without triggering any side effects. It is persisted per `(user, place)` on the place profile and survives across sessions, check-ins, and other mechanics, setting the stage for future reachability flows (availability windows, pings) in later milestones.

## Schema Changes
- Added `place_profiles.isAnchored` (boolean, default `false`, non-null) via migration `0006_place_profiles_is_anchored`, renaming the previous `anchored` column to the new canonical flag.
- Updated Drizzle schema/types to flow the new property through queries, context responses, and API payloads.

## UI Entry Point
- The self-only `ExpandedProfileSheet` now shows an “Anchor to this place” toggle while editing a profile. Toggling updates `/api/me/place-profile` immediately (optimistic UI) and reflects the persisted state; no other surfaces expose anchoring yet.

## Known Follow-Ups (M6b / M6c)
- Wire anchoring into reachability queries for availability/ping mechanics, including visibility of anchored users when relevant.
- Layer in timing windows, rate limiting, and notification/ping delivery once anchoring is consumable.
- Respect existing safety/blocks filtering once anchored users become discoverable to others.
