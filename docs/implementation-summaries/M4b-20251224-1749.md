# M4b — Expanded Profile Overlay & Hook Taxonomy
Date: 2025-12-24  
Run: M4b-20251224-1749

## Goal
Bring the expanded profile experience to the fidelity shown in the mock (overlay page, global status bar, categorical hooks) without touching underlying business logic from M4a.

## Implemented
- Replaced the side drawer with a full-screen overlay (`Dialog`-powered) that dims the place page, locks scroll, and offers a clear close affordance plus alias regenerate action. The autosave badge is now a fixed top status bar (`SaveStatusBar`) that reflects “Saving… / Saved / Error.”
- Broke the UI into sections (alias header, session controls, hook picker, persistent fields) with dark-surface styling, mirrored copy, and keyboard-accessible controls.
- Introduced a full hook taxonomy (`src/lib/hooks-catalog.ts`) derived from the legacy config: categories, hook types (global/city/country/venue), and catalog entries with translation keys. Added `HooksPicker` to render category tabs + toggle chips with the existing max-selection cap.
- Localized all new strings (categories, hook labels, overlay chrome, type badges) in both `en-US` and `de-DE`.
- Removed the legacy free-text hook input and deprecated suggestion chips; hooks now toggle in place and autosave through the existing API wiring.

## Key Files
- `src/components/expanded-profile-sheet.tsx`
- `src/components/profile/{hooks-picker,save-status-bar}.tsx`
- `src/lib/hooks-catalog.ts`
- `src/locales/en-US.json`, `src/locales/de-DE.json`

## Known Issues / Follow-ups
- Hook catalog currently ships in English phrases for both locales; future runs can provide richer translations or city-specific filtering.
- Overlay currently has basic styling (no animations); polish/transition work can stack onto future visual passes if needed.
- The session summary (e.g., “expires in X minutes”) is not displayed yet; we still rely on autosave status and field state.
