# M7a.3 — Metrics & Error Logging

## Admin IA
- Added “Metrics” and “Errors” destinations to the panel nav plus home tiles so the new surfaces are discoverable without guesswork.

## Metrics view
- `/admin/metrics` calls `getAdminMetrics`, which aggregates totals and trailing-24h counts for check-ins (`check_ins`), successful pings (`ping_events` with `status='sent'`), and logged errors (`error_events`). The page renders simple stat cards—no charts, per scope.

## Error events
- Introduced `error_events` table + schema with `created_at`, `source`, `route`, `message`, and optional JSON `detail`. Added `listRecentErrorEvents` + `logErrorEvent` helpers and wired `/admin/errors` to list the 50 most recent entries.
- Hooked API routes `/api/check-ins`, `/api/pings`, and `/api/reports` into the logger so unexpected exceptions now write an error event (email-send failures log as well). Logging failures are swallowed to avoid cascading outages.

## Migration
- Added drizzle migration `0010_error_events.sql` to create the new table and supporting index.
