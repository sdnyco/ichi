# M7a.2 — Admin Portal creation

## UI
- `/admin/portals` now includes a “Create portal” card alongside the existing search form. It surfaces code input, place selector (fed by `listAdminPlaces`), and an enabled toggle, plus contextual success/error banners pulled from query params.
- Added a helper link to `/admin/places/new` and disabled the form when no places exist so admins have clear next steps.

## Backend & validation
- Extended `adminPortals` queries with `createPortalRecord`, `PortalCodeConflictError`, and `PortalPlaceNotFoundError` for guardrails on code uniqueness and place existence.
- The portals action route now branches on `action=create`: validates payload, calls the new helper, and redirects with friendly query params for both failure and success (`success=portal_created` also pre-fills the search filter to the new code).
- Existing enable/disable flow remains untouched for forms that omit `action`.

## Acceptance
- Creating a portal through the UI immediately takes effect (it appears in the filtered results), validation errors persist form state, and enable/disable buttons continue to work as before.
