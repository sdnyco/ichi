# M7x P2 — Profile overlay perspective fix

- Added separate locale strings for self vs. other check-in status:
  - `profile.checkin.statusSelf` keeps the “You checked in …” phrasing.
  - `profile.checkin.statusOther` uses neutral third-person (“Checked into …”) in both English and German.
- `OtherProfileSheet` now checks whether `targetUserId === viewerUserId` when rendering the status and chooses the appropriate copy, keeping the existing timing logic untouched.

Result: viewers see second-person copy only for their own profile; other profiles stay neutral while still showing the correct place/timing info.
