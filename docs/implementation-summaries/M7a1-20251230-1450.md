# M7a.1 — Admin Places list/detail/create

## Admin IA
- Added “Places” entry to the panel nav (`layout.tsx`) and home tiles so the new surface is discoverable alongside Reports/Users/Portals/Check-ins.

## Places pages
- `/admin/places` lists every place via `listAdminPlaces`, showing slug, id, and live portal counts with a CTA to open detail or create new.
- `/admin/places/new` renders a minimal form (name, slug, optional address) posting to the shared server action with inline validation/error echo via query params.
- `/admin/places/[placeId]` loads full metadata and portal list through `getAdminPlaceDetail`, reusing the existing portal enable/disable action per row.

## Server actions & helpers
- Introduced `src/db/queries/adminPlaces.ts` with summaries/details, `createAdminPlace`, slug conflict guard, and `disableAllPortalsForPlace`.
- Added `/admin/places/actions` POST handler supporting `create` and `disable-portals` flows with slug validation and friendly error messages; detail page wires its bulk “Disable all portals” button to this route.

## Acceptance
- Creating a place drops into its detail page, which reflects portal count (0 until wired) and exposes per-portal toggles + “Disable all portals” (no-op when none present).
- The new nav/home entry links to the list page; all other existing admin sections remain untouched.
