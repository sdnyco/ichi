# M7x P4 — remove dead checkout CTA

- The self card in `ExpandedProfileSheet` now surfaces only the descriptive check-in status; the disabled “Check out” / “Coming soon” line was dropped so users no longer see a non-functional control.
- Removed the unused `profile.checkin.checkout` and `profile.checkin.comingSoon` locale strings from both `en-US` and `de-DE` dictionaries to keep translations aligned with the UI.
