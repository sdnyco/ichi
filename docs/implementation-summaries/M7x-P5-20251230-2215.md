# M7x P5 — reuse persisted place alias in check-in drawer

- `PlacePageContent` now passes the stored place-scoped alias (`gallery.viewerProfile?.alias`) down to `PlaceCheckInDrawer`, so the drawer knows when a viewer already has an identity for that place.
- `PlaceCheckInDrawer` seeds and resets its alias state from the persisted alias when present, hides the alias generator step by using a dynamic step list, and clamps the step index whenever the step count changes. First-time visitors still see the alias step with generated suggestions, while repeat check-ins reuse their saved alias without re-rolling.
