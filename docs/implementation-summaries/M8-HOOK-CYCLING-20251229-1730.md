# M8 — Hook Cycling Pass (Implementation Summary)
Date: 2025-12-29
Run: M8-HOOK-CYCLING-20251229-1730

## Goal
Add the CSS-only “push” cycling effect to PlaceGallery hook captions so multi-hook profiles feel alive without introducing new animation libs.

## Implemented
- Memoized hook IDs → localized labels in `GalleryCard`, passing them into a new `CyclingHookCaption` instead of rendering multiple static rows.
- Added `CyclingHookCaption` (with `usePrefersReducedMotion`) inside `src/components/place-gallery.tsx`, handling the push transition via CSS transforms/opacity, `setInterval` cadence (3s), and Tailwind utility timings (240 ms cubic-bezier).
- Ensured reduced-motion users and single-hook cards stay static, timers are cleaned up on unmount, and anchored cards remain untouched.

## Files Added / Updated
- Updated: `src/components/place-gallery.tsx`
- Added: `docs/implementation-summaries/M8-HOOK-CYCLING-20251229-1730.md`

## Known Issues / Follow-ups
- Hook captions currently cycle the first three hooks only; future work might allow longer lists with pagination controls.
- Cycling text is single-line; multi-line support would require a taller slot + revised animation math.
